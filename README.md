# ABF Browser

**ABF Browser** is a web application for managing electrophysiology projects involving ABF (Axon Binary Format) files. It uses a ReactJS frontend which interacts with a PHP back-end exchanging data and commands using RESTful APIs. Eventually I intend to replace the PHP backend with an ASP.NET backend.
